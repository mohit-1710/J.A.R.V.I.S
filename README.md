## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git
cd jarvis

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Configuration

1. **Personalize JARVIS**: Adjust file paths in scripts if needed (especially for notification icons)
2. **Custom Schedules**: Modify `schedule.txt` to set up your daily reminders
3. **Enhanced Security**: Edit the password in `Automation_Brain.py` for system actions
4. **System Integration**: Ensure your microphone and speakers are properly configured

## 💻 Usage

### Starting JARVIS

Three simple ways to bring JARVIS to life:

1. **Double-click** `run_jarvis.bat` from File Explorer
2. **Desktop Shortcut**:
   - Right-click on `run_jarvis.bat` → Create shortcut
   - Drag the shortcut to your desktop
   - Rename to "JARVIS" for easy access
   - Optionally customize the icon

3. **Command Line**:
```bash
run_jarvis.bat
```

JARVIS will run continuously in the background until you manually close the window, and will automatically restart if it encounters any issues.
